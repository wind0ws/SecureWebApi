# SecureWebApi
The infrastructure of Secure WebApi.Both Server And Client Can Verify the signature where client or sever signed.
This is look like amazon s3,Ensure Server is Your Server,Client is your Client.And Others Can't invoke your Api without your permission.
If you dont undestand what I said,I suggest you read the doucument of amazon s3. 
This project contains sample and libray.You can modify it to your own business.


> Attenion Please: 
This is only the client of Android based on OKhttp.
You need a server to host  secure webapi service. For Example Asp.Net MVC WebApi.
